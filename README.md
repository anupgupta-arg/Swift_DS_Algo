# Swift Data Structure & Algorithum

### Binary Search & Linear Search

Searches and sorts can be tricky to visualize and understand. If you need to, go through the video a few more times until it really sinks in. Here is a supplementary visualization that might help as well!

If you feel like you struggled with this material, check out this visualization. There's a coded solution there too, but it's in Python, so let's walk through a Swift implementation.
